What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
- it creates a .git folder in the directory and makes the directory into a git repository

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
-it's an intermediate between the working directory and repository, it allows to add files to it before actually committing it, so that you can commit only what is required and it inturns makes your committs more valuable.

How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    helped me look more closely

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It will save alot of time and make the job easier, rather than going through entire line one-by-one.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?
 Automatically saving helps in case I forgot to save it manually, or system failure but it would cause much more clutter than saving manually.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because Git is programmer/developer oriented while Google Docs is not.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

   git diff file_nameOld file_nameNew
   git log --stat


How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Because I wouldn't have to worry about losing any data, making any errors and taking manual backups.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

  For backing up my projects.
